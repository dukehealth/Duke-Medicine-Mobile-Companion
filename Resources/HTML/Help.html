        <h2>Duke Medicine Mobile Companion</h2>
            
        <p>
        Duke Medicine Mobile Companion is an app designed to work alongside the Haiku and Canto mobile apps used with Duke's electronic medical record.  The app does not do anything by itself.  Therefore, if you have not done so already, you must first download and configure Haiku or Canto using the instructions found on the <a href="http://mobile.dhts.duke.edu">Maestro Care Mobile Device Support</a> site after having been granted permission to use those apps.<br><br>
        
        The primary function of the app is to accept links from Haiku or Canto to display relevant information, such as from a medical reference or decision support tool.  After viewing the information, the app allows the user to quickly return to the Epic app to continue caring for patients.<br><br>
        
        The app can also accept specific links that pass information to other apps installed on your device.  For example, if you click on an address link in Haiku or Canto, the app takes that address and allows you to choose which map app you'd like to use to view that address.  You can configure this on the 'Settings' tab.<br><br>
        
        Duke Medicine Mobile Companion will never be used to view or store patient protected health information (PHI).<br><br>
        
        This app was originally developed by <a href="http://www.rickybloomfield.com">Ricky Bloomfield</a> as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate a few ways to extend the functionality of the Haiku and Canto apps.  This work was presented at the 2014 Epic User Group Meeting in September, 2014.
